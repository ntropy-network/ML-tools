# Cross encoder labeller

- This model use multi-labels transformer (bart or bert). It can process multiple labels in parallel for faster computations (for both training and inference).

- Install project using poetry or pip:

`poetry install` or `pip install .`

- You can use Google Colab for a free GPU.

- To train the models, run the `Train.ipynb` notebook

- To evaluate the models, run the `Test.ipynb` notebook
